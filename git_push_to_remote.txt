when init do:
git init -b main
and then add remote, push normally.

or,

if forgot to init like this, then for pushing to main you need to:
git branch -M main -->this changes name from master to main.

git remote add origin <repo url>

git pull --rebase <your-remote-repo-url>  ---> first we need to rebase; pull the files in the remote e.g 
the README.md file.

git push -u origin main.
